# Degree Adverbs: Experiment 3

## adverbs

A new set of degree adverbs was chosen for minimal lexical ambiguity and homographs, i.e. such that the main sense of the word is the degree modification one.

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=3}

total_1grams = 1024908267229
degree_adverbs = read.table("degree-adverbs-exp3.csv", header=T, sep=",")
print(degree_adverbs)
degree_adverbs$log_prob = log(degree_adverbs$count) / log(total_1grams)
degree_adverbs$sort_order = as.numeric(as.factor(degree_adverbs$log_prob))
degree_adverbs$adverb = with(degree_adverbs, factor(adverb, levels=adverb[sort_order]))
