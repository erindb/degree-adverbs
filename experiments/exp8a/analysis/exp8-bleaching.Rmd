I ran 20 participants on an experiment where I showed them comics where either the word "truly" or the word "very" was used 11 times. The target question was:

![price_question.png](price_question.png)

I also asked how many times participants thought the speaker would use "truly" and "very".

![frequency_question.png](frequency_question.png)

It seems like the stories I gave did not push around people's expectations about how many times Jim would use the words "very" and "truly", although it *seems* to be moving in the right direction.

```{r echo=F, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
dodge = position_dodge(width=0.9)
p = ggplot(data=d_freq, aes(x=word, y=response, colour=word)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=bootsci_low, ymax=bootsci_high, x=word), width=0.1) +
  facet_wrap(~ training_condition) +
  ggtitle("frequency estimates in different training conditions") +
  theme_black()
print(p)
```

I'll try more repetition next time.

As a result of the frequency estimates not changing much, we can't expect the prices to change very much either. And indeed they don't. 

```{r echo=F, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
dodge = position_dodge(width=0.9)
p = ggplot(data=d_summary, aes(x=word, y=logprice, colour=training_condition)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position=dodge) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=bootsci_low, ymax=bootsci_high, x=word),
                position=dodge, width=0.1) +
  ggtitle("prices in different training conditions") +
  theme_black()
print(p)
```

```{r echo=F, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
dodge = position_dodge(width=0.9)
p = ggplot(data=d_diff_summary, aes(x=word, y=diff, colour=training_condition)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position=dodge) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=bootsci_low, ymax=bootsci_high, x=word),
                position=dodge, width=0.1) +
  ggtitle("price diffs in different training conditions") +
  theme_black()
print(p)
```

There also doesn't seem to be any correlation between people's frequency estimates and their price estimates. To the extent that there is any relationship at all, it appears to be kind of positive.

```{r echo=F, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
p = ggplot(data=d_freq_vs_price, aes(x=response.frequency, y=response.price,
                            colour=training_condition)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ word) +
  ggtitle("participants' frequency estimates and price estimates") +
  theme_black()
print(p)
```

```{r echo=F, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
p = ggplot(data=d_price_diff, aes(x=frequency, y=diff,
                            colour=training_condition)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ word) +
  ggtitle("participants' frequency estimates and the difference scores for their price estimates") +
  theme_black()
print(p)
```
