I ran 20 participants on an experiment where I showed them comics where either the word "truly" or the word "very" was used **22 times** (that's twice as many times as in experiment 8a). The target question was:

![price_question.png](price_question.png)

I also asked how many times participants thought the speaker would use "truly" and "very".

![frequency_question.png](frequency_question.png)

This time the stories successfully manipulated participants' frequency estimates. Particpants give higher estimates for how often the speaker Jim will use a word if it is the target word (used 22 times in training) than if it is the control (used 0 times in training).

```{r echo=F, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
dodge = position_dodge(width=0.9)
p = ggplot(data=d_freq, aes(x=word, y=response, colour=word)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=bootsci_low, ymax=bootsci_high, x=word), width=0.1) +
  facet_wrap(~ training_condition) +
  ggtitle("frequency estimates in different training conditions") +
  theme_black()
print(p)
```

In the raw data, this results (at least numerically) in the target word being assigned a less strong meaning.

```{r echo=F, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
dodge = position_dodge(width=0.9)
p = ggplot(data=d_summary, aes(x=word, y=response, colour=training_condition)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position=dodge) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=bootsci_low, ymax=bootsci_high, x=word),
                position=dodge, width=0.1) +
  ggtitle("prices in different training conditions") +
  theme_black()
print(p)
```

And when we recode the data in terms of difference scores (thus getting a lot of subject-by-subject variation) this effect is much clearer.

```{r echo=F, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
dodge = position_dodge(width=0.9)
p = ggplot(data=d_diff_summary, aes(x=word, y=diff, colour=training_condition)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position=dodge) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=bootsci_low, ymax=bootsci_high, x=word),
                position=dodge, width=0.1) +
  ggtitle("price diffs in different training conditions") +
  theme_black()
print(p)
```

Overall, there's a correlation of `r cor(-log(d_freq_vs_price$response.frequency), log(d_freq_vs_price$response.price))` between surprisal (calculated from participants' estmate of the frequency of the word) and the log of their price estimate.

```{r echo=F, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
p = ggplot(data=d_freq_vs_price, aes(x=-log(response.frequency), y=log(response.price),
                            colour=training_condition)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ word) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", colour="white") +
  ggtitle("surprisal (from participants' frequency estimates) and log price") +
  theme_black()
print(p)
```
