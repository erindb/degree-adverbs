I picked some pairs of intensifiers that seem to have similar surprisal in google web ngrams and also get similar prices in Experiment 5.

strongest:
* insanely
* outrageously

mid-strength:
* exceedingly
* amazingly

lowish-strength:
* terribly
* utterly

outrageously_story is the story with "outrageously" as the target word
outrageously1 is a question panel where Jim says "outrageously expensive" for the first person's laptop
outrageously2 is a question panel where Jim says "outrageously expensive" for the second person's laptop
outrageously3 is a question panel where Jim says "outrageously expensive" for the third person's laptop
