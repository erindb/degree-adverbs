      Professional pitchers, like Tom Lyons, are <span id="context1">{{}}</span>
      busy almost every day during the regular season.
      All professional baseball players work hard practicing and playing in games.
      They also have to travel long distances, which can be
      <span id="context2">{{}}</span> tiring.
      Pitchers in particular have a lot of pressure put on them,
      since they play for such long stretches and their role is so
      influential to the outcome of the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because their jobs are so <span id="context3">{{}}</span> gruelling and
      time consuming, most professional pitchers take long, relaxing vacations in the
      off-season. However, Tom Lyons holds several free baseball camps for kids living
      in poor neighborhoods instead of taking a vacation. He spends <span id="article">{{}}</span>
      <span id="target">{{}}</span> large percentage of his free time working
      with children one-on-one and coaching them. Kids love the camps, and the camps
      have a positive effect on the communities in which he runs them.
