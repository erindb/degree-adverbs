I'm truly glad you're
visitin', Bob.
Been a while
since we last
saw each other, yep?
Yep, yep indeed. It's a funny
story, act'lly. truly
entertainin'.
Righty.
Las' winter we had some storms.
They were truly terrible.
Yep, knocked down
power lines all o' the
time. We had flashlights
in etruly room o' the
house.
An' we had some truly good
friends over one night an'
their truly ador'ble li'l son
kep' tellin' us that the truly
tall tree in our yard was
truly pretty an' he wanted to
take it home with him.
We said he couldn't take it
with him cause it was truly
stuck in the ground. Yep.
But he was truly fixed on the
idea cause he loved that
tree. We gave him some crayons
to draw a tree an' take that.
home.
An' the kid said, "Yep, but if
you ever get that truly
big tree out o' the ground,
can I have it?"
So we said, "Yep. Jus' as soon
as it comes out o' the ground,
we'll give it to you."
An' then right exactly then, a
truly big gust o' wind came by
an' took the power out an'
it knocked the truly big tree
over into our kitchen.
truly crazy, yep.

It was almost worth having
to rebuild the kitchen for
how truly suprisin' it was.

We laughed about it for a
truly long while, yep.

An' we had promised the kid
he could have the tree.

So we chopped off a truly
pretty chunk of the tree an'
that chunk is now in that
kid's backyard.

Yep, an' they're goin' to
make a truly nice playground
out o' it.

He was truly
happy, yep.

What d'you think?
That was a truly
good story, yep?
