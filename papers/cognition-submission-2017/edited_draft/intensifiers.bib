	abstract = {The rank-ordered logit model is used as the basic specification for rank-ordered consumer choice data. Two specification tests are proposed for this specification. The first is a Hausman specification test for the independence from irrelevant alternatives hypothesis. The second test examines the possibility that the estimates of equivalent prices are consistent. Two alternative estimators are also proposed. One generalizes the rank-ordered logit specification to allow for a form of heteroscedasticity that permits top ranked choices to be more precisely ranked than bottom ranked choices. The other estimator is an application of a weighted M-estimator that yields consistent equivalent price estimators despite any misspecification of the distribution in the rank-ordered logit model.},

	abstract = {A major open question in natural language research is the role of communicative efficiency in the origin and on-line processing of language structures. Here, we use word pairs like chimp/chimpanzee, which differ in length but have nearly identical meanings, to investigate the communicative properties of lexical systems and the communicative pressures on language users. If language is designed to be information-theoretically optimal, then shorter words should convey less information than their longer counterparts, when controlling for meaning. Consistent with this prediction, a corpus analysis revealed that the short form of our meaning-matched pairs occurs in more predictive contexts than the longer form. Second, a behavioral study showed that language users choose the short form more often in predictive contexts, suggesting that tendencies to be information-theoretically efficient manifest in explicit behavioral choices. Our findings, which demonstrate the prominent role of communicative efficiency in the structure of the lexicon, complement and extend the results of Piantadosi, Tily, and Gibson (2011), who showed that word length is better correlated with Shannon information content than with frequency. Crucially, we show that this effect arises at least in part from active speaker choice.},
