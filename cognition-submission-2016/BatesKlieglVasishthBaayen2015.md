# Parsimonious Mixed Models

## Why am I reading this?

Reviewer 1 mentioned this paper as a good resource in developing defensible linear mixed-effects models that converge.

For reference our factors are:

Random effects:
	* participants
	* intensifier
		- **crossed** with participants
	* (object)
		- **crossed** with intensifier and participants
		- an alternative design would be a "replication design" where intensifier, object, and participants are semi-crossed
		- we can maybe do away with this factor if we normalize?

Fixed effects:
	* surprisal
		- **nested** in intensifier item
	* syllabel-length
		- **nested** in intensifier item
